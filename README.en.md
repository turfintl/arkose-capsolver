# arkose-capsolver
A simple HTTP server to fetch arkose tokens using the CapSolver API.  
Note: CapSolver is a paid service, at $2 / 1000 tokens.  
Note 2: This project is for obtaining arkose tokens required when asking questions on OpenAI ChatGPT.  
Note 3: Due to CapSolverâ€™s sometimes suboptimal recognition accuracy, the wait time might be long. It is not recommended for scenarios with high token demand.

pip3 install capsolver
git clone https://github.com/turfintl/arkose-capsolver.git
